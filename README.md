# Collaboration Directory  

Each member has their own directory to work on. We will practice pushing and pulling to improve our workflow.  

## Assigned Spaces  
- **ðŸŸ¥ Aeron Space** (Red)

2. Work within your assigned directory.  
3. Create a separate branch to avoid conflicts.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
